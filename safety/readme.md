# Safety

When using the internet, it's worth being a bit cautious.

- Be careful about sharing any personal information you wouldn't want to be made public.
- When jamming, you may see or hear unexpected things, like flashing lights or loud noises. You can turn on and off different features in tools like nudel - you can find these settings in the settings menu.
- If you go on to interact with anyone (eg: on a video call, or in-person event), it's best to check if you know who that person is. Make sure it feels safe and appropriate.
- If you encounter something that goes against the [code of conduct](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), you are welcome to contact the people listed on it.
