# Pastagang - Code of Conduct

Where specified, all participants of pastagang spaces, including attendees, performers, organisers and volunteers, are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Please support it and help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## What Is This?

To meet our aim to make inclusive, safe environments, we have outlined expectations of participants. This code applies to pastagang, any related social events and online communities around it. For more information on codes of conduct and why they are neccessary, see http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq

## Inclusion

Please remember that in a pastagang space you will have a group with mixed genders, beliefs, technologies, backgrounds, sexualities and so on.

In all communication - whether that be when promoting the space, addressing others, try to use inclusive language, e.g. remember that ‘guys’ is not a gender-neutral term in many parts of the world, try not to address a mixed group with that.  

The core values that pastagang embodies are:
- non-hierarchical
- openness
- collaboration

## The Short Version

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. This applies both in person or via online media.

## The Less Short Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a facilitators immediately.

At this point, facilitators include: 
- Lu Wilson, todepond@gmail.com
- Daniel, synte@proton.me

Pastagang facilitators will try to be responsive - additionally, all participants (where possible/appropriate) will be briefed on this code and facilitators may ask individual participants to act on their behalf.

If you report an incident of harassment to pastagang facilitators you can expect to be listened to and taken seriously. They will take action they deem appropriate in response depending on the scale and severity of the incident.  For example:

1. Discuss the perpetrator's behaviour with them and ask them to stop.  Explain what they have done and why it is unacceptable.  Remind the perpetrator of the code of conduct.  Monitor the perpetrator’s behaviour and if it improves then they will continue to be welcome in spaces.
2. Temporarily ban the perpetrator from the space.  Explain what they have done and why it is unacceptable and remind them of the code of conduct.  Monitor the person's behaviour in pastagang spaces and if it improves then they will continue to be welcome.
3. Ban them from the space indefinitely.  Explain what they have done and why it is unacceptable and remind them of the code of conduct.

Two or more facilitators will consult with each other before taking steps two or three if possible within a reasonable time frame, depending on urgency.

Pastagang facilitators and those acting on their behalf will be happy to help participants contact police, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in pastagang spaces.
