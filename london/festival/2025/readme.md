# London Live Coding Festival — starting Monday

You may or may not know this, but... Very soon, there's a huge conference going on in Barcelona, all about live coding. Artists from all around the world are traveling in to attend it.

**Here in London, we're in a lucky position. For one reason or another, many of those travelling artists are stopping off in London for a week or two, ahead of the conference. This means: Next week, London will be even more of a mixing pot than usual.**

To make the most of this unique moment, there's not one, not two, but three(!) live coding events happening next week:

1. [Monday 19th May, Algorave](https://lu.ma/ydicdxow) — A classic algorave, but with a massively international setlist. Come and see and dance to artists from London and across the ponds. It will be very good(!). Tickets £8.

2. [Tuesday 20th May, Meetup](https://lu.ma/9l9he1o2) — Come to see and share and talk everything live coding. Beginners and experts welcome! Free.

3. [Wednesday 21st May, Jam](https://lu.ma/nwmbc9gb) — AlgoRhythms. It's like an algorave: Big speakers, projected visuals, good to dance to... but ANYONE can sign up and perform on the night. This is the experimental format that London is beginning to get known for. (Don't miss it if you're an international traveller passing by). Free.

It's gonna be a special week. Whether you come to one event or two or all three, be part of it!

See you soon!!!!!!!
