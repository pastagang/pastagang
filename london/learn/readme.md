# How to learn live coding

At this week's [london live coding](/london) meetup, someone asked how to learn live coding. People gave lots of different suggestions. Here they all are. I've tried to remember them all, but if I missed any, let me (Lu) know on the [london discord server](/london) or anywhere else.

Or if you have anything to add or edit, please [go for it](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/tree/main/london/learn) :)

## Resources

- To learn how to make music with [strudel](https://strudel.cc), the [strudel docs](https://strudel.cc/workshop/getting-started) are really good for beginners. You can always get to it by pressing the "Learn" button on strudel.
- To learn how to make visuals with [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz), check out the [hydra docs](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/).
- Alex McLean made a great [video introduction to live coding](https://youtu.be/-QY2x6aZzqc?si=djIynwmZLAyUdRwy) (thanks yaxu)
- Alex also made some [video tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2lW1zNIIwj3bDkh-Y3LUGDuRcoUigoDs) for learning tidal (for making music) (thanks yaxu)

## Community

- Keep an eye out for workshops and meetups to attend.
- Come and experience an algorave!
- For London events, check out the luma calendar or join the discord. Links for those are [here](/london).
- Try joining a collaborative environment like [nudel](https://nudel.cc). You can learn a lot by coding alongside other people.

## Tips

- In live coding, mistakes are embraced and encouraged and normal. They happen all the time during live sets and it's totally okay. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. 
- There are no stupid questions. Questions are great and live coders love answering them. And it helps the community if you ask them.
- You don't need to learn everything to make good stuff. Learn like 4 or 5 tricks, and then play with them together in different combinations. That's enough to do a load of interesting stuff! You can learn some more stuff later if you like but you don't gotta know much to make good music/visuals!
