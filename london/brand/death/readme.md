# Death of the tadi web: Algorave London 

OH NO! 

Algorave London has DIED. (let code die) 

I recently put out a [blog post](https://www.pastagang.cc/london/brand/) suggesting that we should brand our live coding scene here in London. I put out some surface level reasons for this, and—

When I was writing the post, I went back and forth over whether I should put forward a possible answer to the challenge. In the end I put forward an idea and OH BOY was that a bad idea. 

Perhaps I've learned nothing from my past mistakes. I made the same mistake with the [tadi web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6xOAijwFo) when I first introduced it: I tangled up the problem statement and my proposed solution too tightly and people focused way more on the— Anyway,

Regardless, thank you for all the feedback!

But Yes, there were some very strong reactions to my pitch for "Algorave London", both positive and negative. And while it's healthy for a brand to be a tiny bit edgy, this is probably too much! 

Similar to the tadi web (yes I really have learned nothing), it's hard to— No wait, I've gotta stick to the point.

It's clear to me that everyone is working with vastly different viewpoints and fields of view (wait, do those mean the same thing?) uhh

(let's keep jumping around)

If you have the same flavour of attentional disorder and existential angst as I do, then you probably attend as many events as I do, and you're probably in as many group chats as I am, and you're probably on as many social media sites as I am (not the fascist ones though). and you'll see a lot of the different communities that we have here in London. and you might see them all and think "oh boy it would be really cool if these different separated communities could collaborate and share resources and stuff! and feel even more connected"

Anyway, the goal of this post is not to suggest anything, and it's not even to present any problem statement. This post is about information gathering and sharing! I've started an audit of EVERY SINGLE LIVE CODING AND LIVE CODING ADJACENT EVENT IN LONDON OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS so that we can all see what they are and what they call themselves. and below that, I'll list out all the different organisations. and below that, I'll listed out all of our sibling communities (there's a lot going on in London).

I'll almost certainly miss LOADS so I invite you to join in and [edit the list](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/edit/main/london/audit/readme.md). I put it on the pastagang website so that everyone can change it (all changes get accepted).

Here's the [list](/london/audit).
