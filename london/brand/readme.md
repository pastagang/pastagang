# Branding the London live coding scene

I think we should give the London live coding scene some branding.

<br>

# Context

First, let me give you some background.

## The scene

A lot of live coding and algorave events are happening in London right now, which is great. They are all being put on by different people, which is great.

These events are all helping to cross-promote each other. They are not competing, they are cooperating. They are helping to boost each other up! Attendees that go to one event learn about other events from other people at the event. We promote them all on our [mailing lists](https://lu.ma/londonlivecoding) and [shared group chats](https://signal.group/#CjQKILVUFMuI1r_tNi4k7Ei4aHTOSVZfYljCjnzal_hmKtMlEhDWv7WqmYv7p2DDkHu4_kGQ) and the [discord server](https://discord.gg/YtUVbYznam) and the [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/algorave_london?igsh=MWQ2YWc4c3M2cnA2eA==) and so on. 

There's no central organisation running or managing these, but occasionally a name appears, like "London Live Coding" or "Algorave London" or "Live Code London".

- "Live Code London" is the longest running name, and it's what the community is/was called prior to this recent surge of activity. Maybe it is an 'actual organisation' but I can't find any open information about it so it kind of makes no difference. 
- "London Live Coding" is a name I chose for the luma page to associate it with the [London Coding Scene](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/london/) family of communities. It intentionally follows the same naming pattern as "London Creative Coding" and "London Future of Coding" to associate it with those.
- "Algorave London" is a name picked for a social media account with the goal of promoting the scene and getting more people involved.

## The events

The events that take place in London come with a mixture of styles, with a mixture of names. 

Some are explicitly "algoraves", like the Corsica Studios events, Folklore events, and the occasional one-off event like the upcoming Science Gallery algorave.

Some events are not explicitly named as algoraves, like Noughty Fingers and AlgoRhythms, but I think they're definitely algorave-like or at least algorave-adjacent, and that's how I describe them to people: as algoraves, if not by name then by nature.

Okay okay.

# Why brand?

I think we should give our community a name. There are several reasons for this.

## Channel energy

There is a lot of energy and enthusiasm going towards organising events and community right now. Some of that energy is 'looking for a home' or 'looking for a target' in a way. People are wondering how they can contribute or get involved but don't always know how or where to direct their efforts.

It's hard to point at the vague 'goings-on' if it doesn't have a name:

"Oh you know... all that disconnected stuff that is happening that is actually all connected."

If we can give people a name, we can give people a clearer answer: "Organise an event as part of [name]" is more grounded and concrete than "Organise an event". It gives people an open goal! 

Okay. Another reason:

## It sounds good

We do a lot of advertising of our events because we want people to come and enjoy them with us.

What's the best thing to say when advertising? or telling someone about an event? or inviting someone to an event?

I find it hard to know what to call it sometimes but I've been trying out a bunch of different options and I think that "algorave" is a good word to use, even if the event is not an algorave.

- It's an intriguing word to people who haven't heard it before.
- It's a positive thing to those who have heard it before. 
- It's short.
- It sounds like an actual name and not just an assortment of words. 

Okay okay okay more reasons:

## Include non-algorave events

You might have picked this up by now but I'll give you the spoiler in case you haven't realised it yet: 

**I think we should call the scene "Algorave London".**

The paradoxical thing about this is that it lets us more enthusiastically include a wider variety of non-algorave events under the scene's banner.

What I mean by this is:

I feel the urge to call things algoraves even when they aren't the "classic" algorave event that people think of. For example, I call AlgoRhythms an algorave even though that's maybe doing it an injustice. It's so much more than an algorave! Same with Noughty Fingers. These kinds of events are trying new things and we should emphasize that more. 

However, I think it would be helpful to be able to say something like "AlgoRhythms, put on by Algorave London" so that people kinda know the deal. Or even "promoted by Algorave London" or "recommended by Algorave London" or shared in the Algorave London mailing list or whatever.

The same thing goes for our meetups. They're not really algorave meetups: They're live coding meetups. Maybe it's a small difference, but some of the things shared there are more Pattern Club-esque or Creative Coding-like. Nonetheless, the meetup can still be put on by Algorave London. It doesn't have to be algorave! 

## Values

"Algorave is not a protected brand or franchise" as long as you follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/Algorave/guidelines/blob/master/README_en.md). And it's clear that we, as a scene, share all of algorave's values like: Collapsing hierarchies, Respect for other communities, Diversity in lineups and audiences. 

It's a good fit. 

<br>

Similar to algorave, Algorave London is not and should not be a protected brand or franchise, and anyone should be able to join in and/or organise something under its banner. So far, it's been very much a do-ocracy, or jam-ocracy, and while that kind of structurelessness can have issues of its own, it feels a million times better than a few individuals having complete control. 

By establishing the "Algorave London" name, I think it will be easier to state and share some of these values, so that we can make the scene better: More welcoming, more diverse, more radical(!).

## It's not a terrible acronym

Having recently visited ICLC and discovered all the different TOPLAPs out there in the world, I am reminded of my hatred of acronyms. I don't think we should use an acronym. I still don't know what TOPLAP stands for and hopefully I never will. 

EDIT: Unfortunately I found out what it stands for almost immediately after posting this. fuck you all

So what do you think? Shall we call everything we do "Algorave London"?

Personally, I've started slowly changing names of things whenever I see them, and I'll start using the name from now on.
