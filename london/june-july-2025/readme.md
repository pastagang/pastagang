‚ÄãThe London live coding scene keeps growing as more and more people catch (or re-catch) the live coding bug. I personally think it's great to see such a diversity of events going on put on by different people for different reasons with different angles. There's no central organisation doing this ‚Äî [just] a bunch of people making things happen.

‚ÄãThere's more being planned too! And there's plenty of room for you to get involved! Everyone is welcome, **especially** if you think you don't belong here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Come along to any of these events and get talking to people. Let's make London the most inclusive, diverse, open scene in the world üåê
