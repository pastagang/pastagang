This is a work in progress effort to list out EVERY SINGLE LIVE CODING AND LIVE CODING ADJACENT EVENT IN LONDON, backfilled from the LAST TWELVE MONTHS so that we can all see what they are and what they call themselves. and below that, I'll list out all the different organisations or people behind them. and below that, I'll list out all of our sibling communities (there's a lot happening).

I'll almost certainly miss out LOADS so I invite you to join in and [edit this page](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/edit/main/london/audit/readme.md). I put it on the pastagang website so that everyone can change it (all changes get accepted).
