&lt;insert blog post about abandoning hierarchies here>

# hierarchy

the notion that people or things can be ordered.\
ordered by power. (the archy part)  \
also can mean ordered by priority, or worth.\
right?  \
(edit if not true)

why would we want to abandon that?  \
well, power has problems. it accretes.  \
that is to say it compounds.  \
in simple terms it increases if you have more and decreases if you have less.  \
which leads to abuses, because human fallibility.  \
in short, it's not a great idea to encourage that.

but wait, I have no power so I can't reasonably be expected to worry about it increasing without bounds?  \
no. well, fair enough.

but

what about

community. creativity. amazing audio and visual experiences.

what happens if we place them in a hierarchy?

power accretes.

wait, what?

if something is 'the best'.  \
then something is 'the worst'  \
something is in the middle somewhere.

someone has just started. are they going to be the best? probably not.  \
could they be 'as good' as the best?  \
probably yes.

so maybe. instead of:  \
sort(live coding)

we could just  \
do(live coding)

abandon hierachy  \
abandon comparison

# oh come on &lt;insert favourite artist> is really the best

ok. that's really ok.  \
"this is the best thing EVER" is an ok thing to say. i hear you, I feel you.

but remember.

power accretes

# one other thing

rivalry, wanting to do better, pushing yourself and others. they're all ok. we're fallible humans after all.

but remember. it's a double edged sword.  \
be careful.  \
be human

we collaborate far more than we compete.  \
thats what phrases like "global supply chain" mean.  \
thousands and thousands (actually billions) of tiny little humans working together across time and the planet.

lets work together.

then humans can be the best they can be.

or something

# let's try at least

thanks

# edit

this is the best live coding performance ever.

so we were wrong

but apart from that performance, abandon hierarchy
