# some pastagang things that people do 

i want to be really clear that this blog post is not a set of rules or instructions. you don't have to do these things. and you don't have to do these things to be part of pastagang.

yes, different people and communities are doing different things with "pastagang" and it's interesting to see them all emerge. this is only my description of some of those things that i've seen. you may have seen other things, and i encourage you to [edit this post] to add them yourself.
