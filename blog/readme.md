Welcome to the pastagang blog.

to add a new post, create a folder and drop a readme.md file in it.
for example /name/readme.md will become https://www.pastagang.cc/blog/name/

(you'll need to add the folder and the readme.md file to the blog folder of the pastagang repository over at [github](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/tree/main/blog) - if you're not sure how to do that then [here are some instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files))


posts can be incomplete and updated/enhanced/deleted from time to time
