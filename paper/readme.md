# Pastagang: A huddle of fusili getting silly with the beats B)

## Abstract

<!--This is a first attempt at an abstract. Pastagang is an accidental emergent group that formed in late 2024. In this paper, various participants reflect on their personal experiences of the phenomena. This is Lu writing this right now but I'm pretty sure all of these words will get deleted at some point. Words can be added or edited or removed anywhere. Who knows if people will do this or not. Maybe soon, or maybe months from now.-->

This is a second attempt at an abstract. Pastagang is a jamming group that accidentally emerged in late 2024. In this paper, various participants and onlookers record and reflect on their experience of the phenomenon. In the spirit of the jam, no individual author is responsible for what you are about to read. Instead, it is the natural result of many people editing the same document with no oversight, plan, organisation or discussion. As you read through the following scattered contributions, you may notice glimpses of / fragments of / I dunno... (pls help)

# Introduction

## Backstory

- people enjoyed live coding solo but craved more group jamming.
- how about... instead of doing our live coding "practice" in a solo editor, we all do it in a single multiplayer flok room?
- people occasionally bump into each other in the room and jamming happens.
- no one expected it to become so special.

## Learning & Teaching

As someone who is new to the whole live coding performance thing, it is very intimidating to see with how much finess and focus people can perform in these live events. Because of the sharing nature of the online jam, not only can you look over the shoulder of someone else doing it but you also get access to the code in real time, seeing how they change it and what effects it has. You can copy out code, and understand how it works. Try out some changes and bring them back into the jam. This allowed me to get the confidence needed to just jam with the others. 

Yes, when I switched from strudel to flok, I thought I would learn slower because I wouldn't have the inline docs or autocomplete. But the surprising thing for me was how my learning rapidly sped up, just by looking and seeing other people code. 

I remember thinking things like "`ply`? what does that do?" and then I fiddle with the number, explore it, and try it out myself. 

My <strong>discovery</strong> of different language features was greatly improved by being around other people (in a virtual space). Not just discovery of the existence of these features, but also their varying uses / the moments they can good in.

When you only see cursors jumping on the screen it can seem like they know exactly what they are doing. It takes courage to jump in and change a number. Learning that this is ok, and actually encouraged, is a process. But because you see it happen, it makes doing it a bit easier every time.

The natural highs and lows of activity in the shared room create opportunity for people, to be inspired by others jamming, as well as try out their feet, when no one else (or less cursors) are around. The transition from "real performance" and just goofying around for oneself gets blurry, and before you know it, you lose an hour to a jam with a bunch of people.

<br>

The pastagang culture really invites new people to make changes and fiddle with things. It's really cool when you're groovin' and you have a little idea based on what you've seen other people do, and then you make the change and it all grooves even harder!!

## Audience

I love performing to an audience. I find it very exhilarating. But it can sometimes feel self-indulgent. With jamming, this isn't a problem. It's more collaborative or something blah blah blah...

# Jamming

Pastagang has been one of the most ... of my life. ...

For me, **jamming** means high levels of trust, listening and making space for others. I hope to take these skills into other areas of my life...

I was at the climbing wall today, and I thought "huh, we're all doing our own thing here, what if we *jammed* about it instead?" (that's a climbing pun for all you climbers out there) so I just spoke to people, asked what they were working on, if I could try it. Once two of us were doing it, it became much easier to include other people, and by the end there were about 4 or so strangers all trying different boulders and collaborating on ideas on how to solve them. It felt really good, and social and nice, and was a consequence of me *inviting collaboration* and putting myself *with* (not in front) of other people. I love the social aspect of jamming, and that's something pastagang captures when its at its best. (Sometimes it doesn't, when it doesn't sound groovy, and its all complete strangers, and its lagging like hell because of the cool hydra thing).

## Untitled but might fit in previous section ... #feelings

The thing that I've noticed happens a lot in the collaborative space vs the solo space, and it's sparks of unexpected inspiration. You kind of know, more or less, what's coming when you're livecoding solo. But the moment you get a group dynamic you tend to react to the unexpected coming at you - it's generally a fairly slow burn because you get the new sound, it sparks the inspiration, the inspiration gets turned into code and then you add your piece (and usually tweak it)... then you try to enjoy it for a while.

These sparks of inspiration can lead to learning how to use new functions, or old functions in new ways, or discover new samples, interesting patterns etc

When I'm among familiar players, I like providing that unexpected dynamic on occasion just to see what reactions/changes that causes, and where that can lead to

Sometimes, I run out of ideas/inspiration and don't know what to do with my code. My go to in this scenario is to remove my code altogether and make space (on the screen, and in the density of audio) for someone else to do something (which can reignite the spark in me again). When I'm solo I need to try and keep a constant stream of new ideas going which I often find difficult.

With certain people I very much feel that sense of inspiration far more strongly, it reminds me of the concept of a [muse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_(person)) but it's usually a two-way muse relationship, ie inspiring for both players.

I suspect this is all old news to most accomplished musicians, particularly jazz/improvisational based players - I wonder, does this serve to help validate livecoding as an instrument? Does it even need validation?

## Untitled ... rough account of experience compared to conventional jam sessions

My perspective on jam-oriented programming is shaped by an acute sense of my own lack of formal background in music or programming. Partially because of this, I have mostly pursued these activities non-collaboratively. When I was younger, I did find myself attending conventional jam sessions on two occasions. Everyone brought their specialist instrument but I had never learned how to play one and felt completely blocked both times. There was also a kind of secret jam language that was incomprehensible to me. The guitarist nodded at the drummer and the sound changed. A vocalist shouted "G", glanced, and said "just like last time...". I didn't really know how to participate, so I didn't. As the years went by I experimented more with music (and coding) but always as solo endeavours. I have never felt sufficiently prepared for collaboration in either domain, _especially_ in a live context.

In Flok, the nods and glances were largely textual and readable. There was time to acknowledge and interpret them without needing to immediately act. I could make an adjustment to a sound, then sit back and reflect on its effect before acting again. I had access to a bank of samples and instruments, so I could find something that felt right for the moment and swap it out at will. There were certainly people who knew the environment better, but it never felt like a group of specialists with secret knowledge.

In my first jam, I was admittedly hesitant. I avoided contributing any melodies or rhythms, instead opting for barely-audible textures. After a while, I thought the textures sounded good, so I increased the gain and added more variation. Then I got really confident and added a guitar sound. "Oh no!" â€” it sound terrible! Immediately, some friendly cursors floated over to my pane and helped me make it better. Someone can hand me an instrument, shout "G" and I will freeze. In Flok, someone said "E Dorian", I could see where it should be typed and then I could listen passively to the results of their wise suggestion.

Since then I contributed drums to another jam. There was one moment where I felt like some changes that I was making caused a shift in the sounds that someone else was making. I had never had that experience before when making music!

## Jam Oriented Programming (or another term like that)

talk about nudel and how contributions are approached like a jam as well. everybody can become "maintainer" immediately, being able to change the site without asking. in a jam, communication and decision making happens mostly through the music, less through talking about it. talking is a detour. trust the process. the jam is a SUBSTRATE. similarly, in JOP, people don't need to ask before making a change (they still can if they want to have feedback etc). the software is not part of a critical infrastructure, so breaking it has no severe consequences. similar to how it happens that someone makes a mistake in a jam, it can happen that the thing breaks. it's fine. we even have a backup plan (flok.cc). focusing on a low barrier to entry also means the code should be as easy to understand as possible, so avoiding too many complexities is a good idea. perfection is not the goal. it's better to make a bad contribution than to make no contribution at all.

Before contributing to nudel, I had minimal understanding of open source collaboration. Despite coding extensively in my free time, I never felt comfortable contributing to other's repositories, fearing that my work might not be up to the repository maintainers' standards. However, nudel's community and collaboration practices completely changed that perspective. It fosters a very welcoming environment where even small contributions and changes are encouraged and valued. Whether the code is optimized or well-structured is secondary. What matters is pushing something functional and receiving constructive and actionable feedback. Watching my changes go live on the website gave me a lot of confidence and created a desire to improve and learn new things.

Nudel's low barrier to entry and Jam-like approach allows everyone to be a "maintainer" immediately, encouraging contribution without the fear of failure. Breaking something isnâ€™t catastrophic but rather a part of the process, with backups in place to mitigate issues. This freedom creates space for direct learning from more experienced contributors, while being part of a diverse, supportive community that shares the same goals. With an easy-to-understand codebase, starting a new contribution is seamless. It's this mix of collaboration, creativity, and trust that makes contributing deeply rewarding.

## Cursors

> Analogous to the pulsing live body within other forms of performance, the flashing cursor marks the point of decision-making â€“ of consciousness perhaps â€“ within the live programming of code; the movement of the coderâ€™s thinking as its oscillates between sense-making through the discontinuous, abstract notational form of code and the â€˜continuousâ€™ â€“ even sensuous â€“ experience of coding as a lived experience.

Thoughts about the experience of being cursors on a screen go here

I like imagining myself as a little cursor person. I'm gender-neutral and colourful, and I duck and weave amongst the code. Sometimes I tweak a little number, and we all groove harder. Sometimes I hop out next to someone else's code just to write them a lil' complement. I really like doing that. I think We As A Society should give everybody more encouragement all the time. Being a cursor is freeing.
