## Introduction

This is the guidance for submission to Algorithmic Pattern 2025 via the *HedgeDoc* system. It both demonstrates how to format your submission, and explains how to do so. Once you have read and understood everything, please replace this text with the text of your document.

HedgeDoc uses 'markdown' style formatting, where you write in text, and additional characters to apply formatting. For example to write in italic, place asterisks around it *like this*. You can find some examples below, and more detailed information [in the hedgedoc documentation](https://doc.patternclub.org/features?both).

:::info
You can see and edit the markdown version of this page by clicking the 'pencil' icon on the top bar - this will allow you to see markdown examples. You can view the formatted version by clicking the 'eye' icon, and see both at the same time with the button between them.
:::

Using this system allows us to publish accepted submissions as fully accessible and searchable document on the web, with rich media capabilities, as well as static PDF versions. However, if this doesn't suit you, please refer to our email for the alternative word document template.

## Writing and editing your submission

Once you have read and understood everything, please replace the text of this document with your submission. This includes replacing the title at the top ("Algorithmic Pattern - Paper Template") with the title of your submission, as well as replacing the name, affiliation (if you have one) and email address below it with your own. Repeat this for each author.

You can share this website address with collaborators, and edit it together. If you make a mistake, you can browse earlier versions of your document under the 'Revision' menu item.


Add headings, citations and other footnotes, images, videos and so on to your document, as demonstrated below.

When you are ready, simply copy and paste the website address into the submission form shown on https://2025.algorithmicpattern.org. Feel free to continue to make tweaks to your document up until the deadline.

## Referencing related work

Please add [markdown footnotes](https://doc.patternclub.org/features?both#Footnotes) with references to related work, to put your contribution in context. For example, you might reference physicist and activist Ursula Franklin's "Real World of Technology",^[Franklin, Ursula. The Real World of Technology. 2nd edition. House of Anansi Press, 1999. https://archive.org/details/realworldoftechn0000fran] or Irene Emery's book on the structure of fabric.^[Emery, Irene. The Primary Structures of Fabrics: An Illustrated Classification. 1st edition. New York, N.Y: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 2009.]

Please format references consistently, we recommend [Chicago manual of style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html) referencing style. Please include a website address where the work can be read for free, wherever available.

We recommend the free [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) website and software for collecting and formatting bibliographic references.

## Including images

Where you include images, please add a numbered figure caption, as below:

For longevity, it is best to upload the images to HedgeDoc, rather than add a link hosted on another website.

## Including video material

Please upload videos to vimeo or youtube, and embed as shown. For example to embed a youtube video `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5ObYqWIkyM`, take the identifier in the website address `q5ObYqWIkyM` and place it in the youtube code <!--`{%youtube q5ObYqWIkyM %}` -->. Similarly a vimeo with address `https://vimeo.com/699880166` can be embedded with the code <!--`{%vimeo 699880166 %}` -->.

Please also include captions numbering the video as a figure in italic, as shown before.

{%youtube q5ObYqWIkyM %}

{%vimeo 699880166 %}

*Figure 3: Video - "Algorithms Are Thoughts, Chainsaws Are Tools" by Stephen Ramsay*

## Embedding other content

As advanced usage, you can also embed other material via a HTML 'iframe'. For example the following embeds an algorithmic music example, by embedding the strudel website:

<iframe src="https://strudel.cc/?EZHqjpaU44E5" width="600" height="300"></iframe>

*Figure 4: Strudel 1.1 demo by Felix Roos*

Again, be sure to label and number the embedded content as a figure, as above.

## Other formatting information

For information e.g. on [code formatting](https://doc.patternclub.org/features?both#Code-Block), and [typography](https://doc.patternclub.org/features?both#Typography) please see the [HedgeDoc documentation](https://doc.patternclub.org/features?both), or contact the chairs on the email address below.
