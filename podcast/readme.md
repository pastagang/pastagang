## How to make an episode

Record an episode! Then list it on this page. Edit the page [here](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/edit/main/podcast/readme.md).

## Format ideas

You can do any format you want, but here are a couple ideas for formats if you're looking for one:

### Jam format

two pastagangers talk and share their perspective on pastaganging
- where and when they do it
- how they approach and think about it
- anything else

the episode starts and ends with a little jam

### Signature move format

take turns showing each other a 'signature move' you like to do.

- how do you do it
- how does it work
- why do you like it

you could do start and end with a jam if you want

## Where to upload the episode

It could be anywhere. someone could probably set up an RSS feed or mailing list or something 🤷

We could probably also upload audio-only as well as video

Maybe we could reach out to [compute.radio](https://compute.radio) to host the podcast, I dunno!
