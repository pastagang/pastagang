## How to make an episode

Record an episode! Then list it on this page. Edit the page [here](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/edit/main/podcast/readme.md).

You can do any format you want, but here's an idea for a format if you're looking for one:

two pastagangers talk and share their perspective on pastaganging
- where and when they do it
- how they approach and think about it
- anything else

the episode starts and ends with a little jam

## Where to upload the episode

It could be anywhere. someone could probably set up an RSS feed or mailing list or something ðŸ¤·

We could probably also upload audio-only as well as video

Maybe we could reach out to [compute.radio](https://compute.radio) to host the podcast, I dunno!
