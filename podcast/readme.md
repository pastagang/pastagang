## Make your own episode

You are welcome to add your own episode to the podcast.

Record an episode! Then list it on this page. Edit the page [here](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/edit/main/podcast/readme.md).

## Format ideas

You can do any format you want, but here are a couple ideas for formats if you're looking for one:

### Jam format

two pastagangers talk and share their perspective on pastaganging
- where and when they do it
- how they approach and think about it
- anything else

the episode starts and ends with a little jam

### Signature move format

take turns showing each other a 'signature move' you like to do.

- how do you do it
- how does it work
- why do you like it

you could do start and end with a jam if you want

## Where to upload the episode

It could be anywhere. someone could probably set up an RSS feed or mailing list or something ðŸ¤·

It can be audio-only, or include your screen and/or camera as well.

## Safety

As always, be a bit cautious when interacting with people over the internet :)
